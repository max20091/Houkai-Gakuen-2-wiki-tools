# Lossless PNG Compressor
A simple and lossless PNG Compressor using Oxipng zopfli compression, save up to 30% space compared to "uncompressed PNG"!

Would prefer [WebP Compressor](https://github.com/max20091/Houkai-Gakuen-2-wiki-tools/tree/main/Tools/WebP%20Compressor "WebP Compressor") than using this inefficient file format these days.
## Usage
- Run "PNG Compressor.bat" for the first time to create file folder
- Download pre-compiled oxipng or compile the program from [github.com](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng "github.com") then put "oxipng.exe" in the same folder as "PNG Compressor.bat"
- Put any PNGs to the file folder, run "PNG Compressor.bat" and get the image when the program is done compressing.
